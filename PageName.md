The FurbSpeech project uses Maven 2 to manage all dependencies with third-party libraries. Maven can also be used to build the JAR file of the library. If you are using Eclipse IDE, you can import the FurbSpeech source code and download all the dependencies executing the Maven goal **eclipse:eclipse**. After do this, you can generate the JAR and install it in your local repository executing the goal **clean install**.
